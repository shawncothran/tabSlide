Approach

This was a great project, built to work on my skills. It had a wide dynamic range of possible approaches, as well as running the gamut from design to logic.

I opted for gradients, shadows or text where appropriate, and used the minimum amount of images necessary, using correct semantics, to be as performant and accessible as possible.

Classes and IDs are named with teamwork, collaboration and approachability in mind, so they speak to their meaning and content.

The scripts are written for modularity and extensibility, so as not to be painted into a corner were the project to grow, change or expand. All functionality and styling is relevant and usable even with scripting disabled, except the dynamic friend content (of course).
